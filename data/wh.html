    <h1 class="hwh">Why Hindu Rashtra?</h1>

    <div class="content">
        <p>Because Freedom is the core of Hinduism. Hindus accept everyone from theist to atheist, from Shankaracharya
            to
            Charvaka. No one is left out. Technically speaking, look at this graph below:</p>
        <div class="r">
            <img src="pr.png" alt="polytheistic religion">
        </div>


        <p>This is the mindset of a typical hindu. In Hinduism, all beliefs are accepted. Hindus love their belief but
            also respect others beliefs as well. This welcoming mindset is only possible in a polytheistic religion like
            Hinduism. Because Hindus believe in freedom and they are free to believe in anything. Hinduism is a religion
            of freedom in its truest sense. On the contrary, look at the graph below:</p>

        <div class="r">
            <img src="mr.png" alt="monotheistic religion">
        </div>

        <p>This is the mindset of a typical monotheistic person. In Monotheism, only one belief is the truth and all
            other beliefs are considered false. So in the eyes of monotheistim, society is divided into true believers
            and false believers. So its natural for the followers of monotheism to diminish or destroy the beliefs which
            they consider false. In other words, followers of monotheism are programmed to kill or convert others from
            different religions. This anti-social mindset is only possible in monotheistic religions like Islam and
            Christianity, because monotheism doesn't embrace freedom and instead their belief divides the society.</p>

        <p>As Hindus, we have always accepted everyone including monotheism without any discrimination just because it's
            like any other belief system. But now Hindus are getting killed by merely speaking out. So it is time
            that we openly start to discriminate between right and wrong belief systems, good and bad mindset, moral and
            immoral religions.</p>

        <div class="r">
            <img src="kk.png" alt="Kanhaiyalal Killers">
        </div>

        <p>So to conclude, not every religion is equal and the slogan 'sar tan se juda (beheading)' is a wake-up call
            for all Hindus. Bhaarat should never accept any belief system which produces anti-social elements in the
            name of religion. Any belief system which is against Life, Freedom or Society, should be discarded
            immediately.</p>

        <p>That's why we need Hindu Rashtra. We have to vote as UNITED to make Bhaarat a Hindu Rashtra, because if we
            vote as united then anything is possible. We will let you know which independent candidate to vote for in
            the next general elections, through social media and this website. If you also wish for Hindu Rashtra then
            feel responsible to spread this website, and follow us on social media.</p>
